# Game-of-Life-with-Neural-Networks
Conway's game of life is a cellular autometon, which produces complex behaviours from a few simple rules.
This Reposetory compares the performence of different neural network architectures on the task of predicting the next state in Conway's game of life.

## Architectures

### 1. CNN
The CNN Architecture consists out of 2 Layers with 8 and 1 feature maps, with a Relu activation function in between and a Sigmoid activation function after the second layer.

### 2. CNN residual
The CNN Architecture consists out of 2 Layers with 8 and 1 feature maps.

### 3. MLP

### 4. MLP residual
