# Game-of-Life-with-Neural-Networks
Conway's game of life is a cellular autometon, which produces complex behaviours from a few simple rules.
This Reposetory compares the performence of different neural network architectures on the task of predicting the next state in Conway's game of life.

## Architectures

### 1. CNN

### 2. CNN residual

### 3. MLP

### 4. MLP residual
